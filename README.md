# Curses Games
A collection of games made in curses, so far theres only one but I intend to make more

## TTYO
A puyo-like that runs in the terminal. Right now it's fairly bare bones. 

### Installation
To run it copy the two lines below into the terminal and it should start.
```
git clone git@github.com:hhhhhhhh1233/Curses-Games.git
make run
```
It'll create a file called ```ttyo``` that you can run anytime.
